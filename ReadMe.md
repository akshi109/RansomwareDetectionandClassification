# Ransomware Classification & Detection

###  Overview
This project focuses on identifying ransomware samples using classical Machine Learning techniques in Python. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

###  Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

---

###  Project Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Feature selection / feature extraction  
3. Splitting dataset into training & testing  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
6. Visualization of confusion matrix and feature importance

###  Results
- Include your final **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** after running your notebook.  
- Add a short summary of model behavior.
