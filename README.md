# RansomwareDetectionandClassification
This project focuses on detecting ransomware using classical Machine Learning techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation using algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The model's effectiveness is measured through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
